# SAIM
Analysis code for SAIM (scanning angle interference microscopy) analysis

MultiAngleFLIC--source code for executable that uses Intel libraries to execute a lot of the behind the scenes math and optics. Base authored by Matthew Paszek and published in Nature Methods. My work is built on top of his framework to implement the ability to handle more models, including the addition of a material of variable refractive index on top of the silicon imaging surface.

Mapping: post processing to output visualization of SAIM data.
